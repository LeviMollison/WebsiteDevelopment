		This site was born as an idea for a final project to my web development class of my Spring 2015 semester at NYU Polytech. The idea started off as simply creating a website where one could look up different nuzlocke adventures, get some idea how they are going, and be able to visit the site where the nuzlocke is being held. After some research I came to find that nuzlocke comics were strewn all over the internet, not having a home of their own anymore. I decided to create a home for them to reside in: where users could come and visit, read and perhaps contribute in the near future. The site will start off hard programmed, until I learn how to incorporate data base usage into the front end development.
